# Club Manager with Django

## Introduction

This project is a fully fuunctional Club Management Website for any Education Institute. I had originally built this as my institution at the time did not have a efficient process for Club Members to manage their clubs and activities. This app covers everything from Account Creation all the way to report submission on various activities. In this ReadMe, I will cover everything from app functions to various levels of authorization. There will be some images at the end to showcase the application. [The images are a placeholder till I find someplace to host this app.]
