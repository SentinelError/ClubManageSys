# Club Manager with Django

## Introduction

This project is a fully fuunctional Club Management Website for any Education Institute. I had originally built this as my institution at the time did not have a efficient process for Club Members to manage their clubs and activities. This app covers everything from Account Creation all the way to report submission on various activities. In this ReadMe, I will cover everything from app functions to various levels of authorization. There will be some images at the end to showcase the application. [The images are a placeholder till I find someplace to host this app.]

# Description

I had built this project as my for an assignment in the 6th Semester of College timetable. After submission, I continued to tinker with it extensively working new functionalities. 

I was given the task of creating a functional website to manage club affairs and allow a singular place club members could go to find information on their club activities and important dates. As such, I began working on the idea for this website. I chose Django due to it's excellent coding support in allowing to work with Python code and connect that with HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's beginner friendly layout and how the templates are formed and linked through urls were quite intuitive and interesting. As the Web Application came together, **I built various levels of _user authorization_** :

_The Highest Level of authorization_ : **The SuperUser**
The SuperUser role was assigned to the Club Managers. [The teacher assigned to club] They had control over almost all of the functionalties the App provided from Venue creation to editing User data. However they weren't allowed to write reports as that functionality was explicitly reserved for the Student Representatives of the clubs.
